## PSLIB
All kind of particles  
[PSLIB](https://tic80.com/play?cart=85)

## UI Library TICuare  
Build great user interfaces, based on Uare  
[TICuare](https://github.com/Crutiatix/TICuare)

## Collision Detection
Lua collision-detection library for axis-aligned rectangles  
[Collision](https://itch.io/t/72354/collision-detection-library-bump-and-simple-demo-for-tic-80)

## Make Gradient
A library that will allow you to create color gradients easily. Details in the first comment. As a side bonus, you also get rgb/hsv conversion routines and lerp function since it requires these to work.

## LZW Image Compression
Compress image and store it as string. Decompress in Lua.  
[LZW](https://github.com/deck-dev/LZW-image-compression-for-TIC)

## FC-RLE: RLE Image Compression
Compress an image and store it as a string in run-length encoding. Decompress it in game with a few small helper functions.
