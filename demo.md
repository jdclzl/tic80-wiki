The `demo` command displays a list of demo games, one of which has flashing lights. `benchmark.tic` contains a warning about this because it is that game with this content. The `demo` command cannot load a demo, instead, use `load ()` without the `.tic` extension.

Here is a list of the demos (WIP):
* [`benchmark.tic`](Benchmark) (with flashing lights)
* `sfx.tic`
* Please help add more demos!
