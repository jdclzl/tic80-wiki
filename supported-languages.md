# Supported Languages

TIC-80 Supports multiple scripting languages, including:

* [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org)
* [Javascript (ES5)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org)
* [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org)
* [Wren](http://wren.io/)


TIC-80 also supports compiled languages via
our [WASM support](wasm).  If your compiled language of choice can compile to Web Assembly there is a good chance you could use it to develop for TIC-80.

### Starting a new compiled from source project

- See [WASM Support](wasm).

### Starting new scripting project

To see a demo or start a new project in your scripting language of choice just start up TIC-80 and from the console type `new [lang]`, for example for a Wren project just type:

```
new wren
```

or

```
help new
```

for some on-screen guidance.
